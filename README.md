# p5-starter
A minimal p5.js starter kit with the following features:

## CCapture to mp4 with spacebar

Uncomment `ccapturer` line in `index.html` to enable. Then press Space to start recording the canvas into an mp4

## `keyPressed.push(fn)`

All functions passed into this array will be called when p5 calls `keyPressed()`. This is helpful for splitting it across multiple files (eg to record the canvas into a mp4)
